## Project Background Description
//TODO

## Project Problem Statement
While self-piloting is available in high end drones, it is generally not available in low-cost drones due to a lack of available sensors and computation.
By augmenting the existing capabilities of a low-cost drone with fixed external cameras and computation, we intend to improve the navigation capbilities of the drone at an affordable price. These external cameras and computation can be scaled out to an arbitrary number of drones without increasing cost.


## Inadequecy of Current Solutions
Current solutions to automate drones are costly due to the required hardware. We want to take a cheap, off the shelf drone, and a fixed camera, to improve the flying accurracy of the drone.

## Background Skills/Interests

- Embedded Programming
- OpenCV
- Drone Technology

## Problem Approach
* We want to take a camera and point it at a flying drone, using automation we want to enable the drone to stay in a static location based upon input recieved from the camera
