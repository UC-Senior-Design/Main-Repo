## Project Background Description

While self-piloting is available in high end drones, it is generally not available in low-cost drones due to a lack of available sensors and computation.
By augmenting the existing capabilities of a low-cost drone with fixed external cameras and computation, we intend to improve the navigation capabilities of the drone at an affordable price. These external cameras and computation can be scaled out to an arbitrary number of drones without increasing cost. The main challenge we have decided upon is to have the drone play a board game. Board games require very precise movements so we think this will help us in finding the best system for automating drone movement with external cameras.

## Project Problem Statement

This project doesn't have a direct problem to solve, so we created one. We will be using board games as a way to test the drone's precision in its automated movements. Our goal is to have two drones playing each other in chess completely autonomous. The outcomes of the project would be the capability to autonomously control a cheap drone with a cheap camera. This should improve ideas in the field on how precise movements of drones can be accomplished.

## Inadequecy of Current Solutions
Current solutions to automate drones are costly due to the required hardware. We want to take a cheap, off the shelf drone, and a fixed camera, to improve the flying accuracy of the drone.

## Background Skills/Interests

- Embedded Programming
- OpenCV
- Drone Technology

## Problem Approach
* We want to take a camera and point it at a flying drone, using automation we want to enable the drone to stay in a static location based upon input recieved from the camera
