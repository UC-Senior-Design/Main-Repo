# Task List

## SDK

Assignee: Matt Manley

The Maverick drone SDK requires investigation to determine if we will be able to use the Maverick drone for our project.

- Identify the capabilities of SDK for the Maverick drone
- Identify the limits of the SDK (find what sensors we can get data from)
- Create prototype for testing drone
- Build system for consuming data
- Build system for processing and manipulating data
- Build system for flight control based on processed data

## Navigation

### Vision

Assignee: Joseph Krusling

Visual navigation needs to be investigated to determine limits and capabilities. We may not use visual navigation depending on limits.

- Identify visual sensors used in existing robot navigation applications
- Identify each sensor's capabilities and limits
- Identify what algorithms are needed to successfully use the data from the sensors
- Devise plan for using visual sensors for navigation and determine what is lacking in the vision navigation

### Non-Vision

Assignee: Tanner Bornemann

Non-Visual (RF, sonar, lidar, etc) navigation needs to be investigated to determine limits and capabilities.

- Identify non-visual sensors used in existing robot navigation applications
- Identify each sensor's capabilities and limits
- Identify what sensor's can be used together
- Identify what algorithms are needed to successfully use the data from the sensors
- Devise plan for using non-visual sensors for navigation and determine what is lacking in the non-vision navigation
