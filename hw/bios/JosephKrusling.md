# Professional Biography
I am Joseph Krusling, a senior studying computer science at the University of Cincinnati. I'm presently working part-time developing applications and robotic control software at EST Analytical.

I have spent much of my life pursuing personal software development projects for the sake of interest. My experience working in small and informal teams over the years has made me accustomed to wearing many hats.

## Project Sought
I'm open to project ideas of all kinds, but I'd like to do something ambitious and ideally philanthropic. I prefer a project that can be completed without loose ends by the end of the year and I'm not interested in developing any kind of startup or continuing development long into the future.

I'm particularly interested in these topics:
- Automation
- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
- Virtual Reality
- NLP and NLU
- Robotics
