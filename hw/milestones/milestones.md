# Road Map

This document describes our project's road map made up of milestones, a timeline and an effort matrix for our project.

## Milestones

- Drone Control
  - This milestone requires control of a drone from a host computer.
- Drone Status Feedback
  - This milestone requires data from the drone that contains status and sensor information that can be processed on the host computer.
- Positioning and Tracking
  - This milestone requires status and sensor information to be processed into positioning and tracking data
