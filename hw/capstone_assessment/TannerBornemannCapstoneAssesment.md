## Project Summary

Our project focuses on researching and exploring precise movements with off the shelf drones. The idea is to be able to make precise, automated movements with a drone that costs less than $200. Many higher end drones have a sweet of sensors that enable a pilot very precise control. These types of drones often cost well over $1,000, and thus are often out of reach for many people. This project will investigate the types of movements of a cheap drone by playing a board game. Board games often require precise and focused movements, so we will use a board game like chess as a test.  Computer vision will be investigated to determine if we can automate a drones movements using external cameras. I believe this project will provide many unforeseen challenges that we will add to our experience and capacity as Computer Scientists.

## Academic & Professional Experience

As a Computer Science student at the University of Cincinnati I like to think that I have learned quite a few things in the field of computer science. For this project specifically there are a few classes that come to mind that may guide our development of this project. Python Programming (CS 2021) and Programming Languages (CS 3003) will be helpful for actual software development of our project. Software Engineering (EECE 3093C) will help guide the structure and organization of the software development. I also believe Design & Analysis of Algorithms (CS 4071) and AI: Principles and Applications (CS4033) will help with the algorithms required for computer vision and designing algorithms for the automated movements of the drone. There are many other classes I have taken that I am sure will positively influence my work on this project.

My CO-OP experience has been as enlightening as my classes. I have worked at EST Analytical for the last 5 years as a Software Engineer. I was lucky enough to start my career earlier than most in the CS program. I work with a few different robots mostly doing desktop software development, with some embedded programming sprinkled in. I think my experience working at EST will provide useful project management skills and communication skills. I think my experience will also improve my ability to work out a project design earlier that will work out in the end and not have to be revamped. I feel this is a skill that only comes with experience.

## Motivation & Project Approach

I am motivated by this project partly because it is a requirement to graduate, but also the experience I will gain throughout its completion. Working with drones and computer vision sounds very interesting to me because I have always liked drones and have never worked with computer vision. Automating the movements of a drone to play a board game will be really interesting, especially the algorithms involved with automating the actual game playing. Its also nice to work on a new project outside of the same old stuff at work. I'm curious about how many unforeseen technical challenges we will find. I enjoy solving problems and I am sure this project will contain many different problems to solve.

Initially we are planning on trying cameras as the way to collect real time data of the drone's state. With this data we should be able to determine the drone's position, yaw, pitch, and whatever else we may need. I expect this to work and be usable for the end goal of the drone playing a board game. To evaluate contributions we will break the project down into tasks and assign them to team members. As we progress on our tasks we will use a review process for everyone's work. For the software tasks we will use a code review format in GitHub and for any other tasks we will use a discussion review that is in person.
