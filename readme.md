## Project Abstraction

Unmanned aerial vehicles rely principally on GPS for localization and navigation, so
GPS-deprived environments pose a major challenge. We seek to explore and
implement various strategies for automating UAV flight without access to GPS. The
first strategy entails the use of many fixed cameras placed in the environment, which
identify the location of the UAV through the fusion and analysis of their individual
camera feeds. The second strategy uses WiFi signals obtained from numerous access
points and analyses the relative signal strengths to localize the UAV. These
strategies will be used simultaneously to achieve robust localization.
